PROJECT TITLE: Simple 2 Player Game Room 

MOTIVATION: Use this to develop games/projects that require interaction between two players. 
-This code is not fully implemented and requres additional development. 
-Console shows an array of the current players based on their connection id and the current active rooms. 
-There will never be more than two players per room. 
-The application does not re assign a player to a vacant room once their opponent leaves
-This is a very simple implementation of express.js and socket.io

INSTALLATION:
	1) Within the repository:
		npm i 'name of module'
		ex) npm i express
		-Do this for all modules

	2) localhost:3000 on machine
